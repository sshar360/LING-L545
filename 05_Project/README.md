# Tri-Lingual Sign Language Translator

`Sign language is mostly utilized by
hearing-impaired and mute people to communicate within and outside of their social groups. The goal of sign-language
recognition(SLR), is to identify acquired hand motions and to continue until
related hand gestures are translated. The
fact that some or all of the ordinary people do not speak this language and that every country has its sign language creates a
barrier to communication. I have created a
model that can understand the gestures and
translate them to cater to a wider audience.
By developing Deep Neural Network
architectures, the model will learn to detect letters and once the model successfully recognizes the gesture, a relevant
letter is generated. This paper will be a
two-fold endeavor with comparative study
as the research part and Tri-Lingual sign
language translator, as the application part.`
